- Rules: Use BunJS only in this project.
- Do not use `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` commands.
- Use `bun run <script>` for all project scripts.
- Add `tsc` build check as `bun run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`).
- Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun run format` as the final verification step of each task.
